## Brushes
Containing Hei's attempts at making Procreate brushes.
### [Willow](brushes/Willow.brush)
- I think it works as intended this time. Rare success!!!

### [Labour-intense Flare](brushes/Labour-intense_Flare.brush)
- intention: make painting distant city lights easy
- result: need to hit the same spot 5-10 times to get good flare effect

### [Fluffy-boi](brushes/Fluffy-boi.brush)
- intention: grass
- result: good for fluffy clouds
